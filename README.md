# OpenGL-Village-World
This OpenGL-based Computer Graphics project presents a dynamic animated village scene featuring natural and rural elements such as rivers, trees, houses, grain fields, clouds, and hills, alongside animated objects like boats, planes, rain, sun, moon, and a rotating waterwheel. The project supports four visual scenes—Day (press 1), Rainy Day (press 2), Night (press 3), and Rainy Night (press 4)—each with unique environmental effects. Users can interact in real-time: pressing W rotates the waterwheel, S stops the boat, R resets boat and plane to default speed, while left mouse click increases and right mouse click decreases their speed. A variety of objects have been included such as riversides, chaff, fireplace, windmill, ripples, rain splashes, stars, and even a human flying a kite. This immersive and interactive rural environment was developed using OpenGL and GLUT, with modular object design and smooth animation for educational and visual demonstration purposes.
